## About me
## My name is Jared and I'm from Colorado. 
### My Hobbies
* I play **guitar** and love Rock and Alternative music
* I love science fiction and fantasy stories
  + My favorite book is *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*
* I am a big fan of movies and video games
  + Some of my favorite movies are *The Matrix* and *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*
* I act and have been doing mainly Shakespeare plays lately

#### I am majoring in TAPS and Fundementals and am a rising 2nd year in *The College*
##### I have found Markdown and using R to write to be very awkward for this, but that might just be because I don't like talking about myself. The whole Github workflow seems unneccisarily confusing but I'm sure that will become easier with time. 
###### Now here is a photo of my favorite childhood animal:
